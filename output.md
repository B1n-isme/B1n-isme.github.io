PROJECTS
MultiHorizonBitcoinPriceForecasting| pytorch-lightning,nixtla,matplotlib,pandas,statsmodels                                  LINK
• Built a horizon-aware Bitcoin forecasting system across 5 horizons (7/14/30/60/90 days) using Nixtla’s statsforecast and neuralforecast, with expanding-window CV (step = horizon) for fair, scenario-specific evaluation.
• Engineered a robust feature pipeline: target modeled as log-returns with price back-transform; stability selection across
xgboost/lightgbm/random forest with bootstrapping; multicollinearity control via VIF/correlation pruning.
• Automated model selection and evaluation: statistical (AutoARIMA/ETS/Theta) and neural
(iTransformer/TCN/TFT/TSMixer); metrics include MAE, RMSE, MASE, Directional Accuracy; training time tracked for
efficiency comparisons.
• Delivered actionable insights: horizon-specific winners—TCN (7/14d), ETS (30/60d), TFT (90d); observed U-shaped
complexity–performance pattern and concept drift between CV and holdout.
• Made it fully reproducible: parameterized via config file, deterministic seeds, timestamped artifacts and plots under
results/, and CLI entrypoints for feature selection, CV, final forecasting, and visualization.

• Implemented an object detection model to accurately identify yellow flies using a lightweight YOLOv8n architecture,
suitable for edge device deployment.
• Analyzed model performance using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and mAP to assess detection accuracy.
• Tuned hyperparameters and adjusted training settings based on metric insights to improve detection accuracy and
• Using (best.pt) trained model to detect object in images and videos, showcasing its practical applicability.
 JourneyBotRAGChatbotWebsite|Python,Javascript,Chainlit,LangChain,Ollama, HuggingFace                               LINK
• Develop a Travel Assistant to provide customized travel recommendations and itineraries based on API data, embedded
PDFs, and knowledge of the Ollama model.
• Create a pipeline to extract, split into chunks, and vectorize PDF content using sentence transformer model.
• Store vector embeddings on Pinecone Vector Database cloud platform.
• Enhancing UI Interface with animations and responsive design, allow users to directly attach file.



Work Experience
TMA Solutions                                                                                                  Feb 2025 – May 2025
AI Engineer Intern
• Build an automated data collection tool using OpenCV, Mediapipe Holistic, featuring gesture-based recording triggers and
perform real-time extraction of multi-modal landmarks, and finally saving structured sequences into parquet format.
• Developed a training solution by building a data pipeline with sophisticated augmentation (affine transforms) and creating a
novel Dynamic Loss Function. This combined approach simultaneously improved model generalization and effectively
mitigated severe class imbalance by focusing on hard-to-classify samples.
• Research and adapt a custom Transformer architecture called ‘Siformer’, with Feature-Isolated mechanism to concurrently
processes hands and lips part through separate encoder streams. Enhanced the model with a Cross-Component Attention
mechanism to capture inter-part dependencies and integrated an Input-Adaptive early-exit strategy for optimized inference
speed.
