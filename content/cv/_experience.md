**TMA Solutions**  
AI Engineer Intern  
*February 2025 â€“ May 2025*
- Built an automated data collection tool using OpenCV and MediaPipe Holistic, featuring gesture-based recording triggers and real-time extraction of multi-modal landmarks, saving structured sequences in parquet format
- Developed a training solution by building a data pipeline with sophisticated augmentation (affine transforms) and creating a novel Dynamic Loss Function to improve model generalization and effectively mitigate severe class imbalance
- Researched and adapted a custom Transformer architecture called 'Siformer' with Feature-Isolated mechanism to concurrently process hands and lips through separate encoder streams
- Enhanced the model with Cross-Component Attention mechanism to capture inter-part dependencies and integrated Input-Adaptive early-exit strategy for optimized inference speed

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented real-time gesture recognition system
- Developed novel loss function that improved model performance on imbalanced datasets
- Created innovative Transformer architecture for multi-modal data processing
- Achieved significant performance improvements in model training and inference efficiency
