Hi, I'm Linh Nguyen-Truc ðŸ‘‹ You can call me Linh ðŸš€

I'm a recent **Computer Science and Engineering** graduate from [**Vietnamese-German University (VGU)**](https://vgu.edu.vn). I completed an **AI Engineer Internship** at [**TMA Solutions**](https://tmasolutions.com), where I built real-time data pipelines, designed custom Transformer architectures, and optimized training for imbalanced, multi-modal gesture data.

I work across **Computer Vision**, **NLP**, and **Time Series Forecasting**, with hands-on projects like **Multi-Horizon Bitcoin Forecasting**, **Yellow Fly Detection (YOLOv8)**, and **JourneyBot RAG Chatbot**.

**Core Skills**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO, LangChain, Time Series (Nixtla), SQL, and data engineering for ML.

I'm driven to build practical, reliable AI systems and continuously level up. ðŸŒŸ
